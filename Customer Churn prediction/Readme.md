# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and using machine learning models to predict customer churn in a telecom company.

## Project Description

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Analyzed customer data to understand patterns and factors contributing to churn.
  - Visualized data to identify trends and insights.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict customer churn.
  - Models used include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Compared model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and usage metrics, and is sourced from [Kaggle Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets).
