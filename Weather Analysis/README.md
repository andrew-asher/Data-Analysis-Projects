<h1><p><strong>Real-World Weather Data Analysis</strong></p></h1>

**Description:**

This project involves analyzing a real-world weather dataset to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions related to weather conditions, wind speed, visibility, and more. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical calculations, and data manipulation to provide comprehensive answers to the posed questions.


**Objectives:**

Identify all unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.

Count the number of occurrences when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.

Determine the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.

Detect and list all Null Values in the data.

Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'.

Calculate the mean 'Visibility'.

Compute the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in the dataset.

Find the Variance of 'Relative Humidity'.

List all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.

Identify instances where 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.

Calculate the Mean value of each column for each 'Weather Condition'.

Determine the Minimum & Maximum value of each column for each 'Weather Condition'.

Display all records where the Weather Condition is 'Fog'.

Find all instances when the 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.

Identify instances when:
'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50', or
'Visibility is above 40'.
